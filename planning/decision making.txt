Host decision, eat in or delivery

Question
  4 options
    Each option is associated with (a) cuisine(s), price range or locality
  
Compile associations into data structure

resultRaw = {
  price = ['$', '$$', '$$$', '$'];
  cuisine = ['chinese', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'indian' 'western'];
  locality = [10, 50, 10, 5, 5, 50, 5];
  takeawayOrDineIn = "t" or "d";
}

Determine:
- Mean price range (round to lower range)
- Median cuisine
- Median locality (round to lower range)

resultProcessed = {
  price = '$';
  cuisine = 'chinese';
  locality = 5;
}

find restaurant which has closest match (in terms of price, cuisine and locality) to the processed data
  - assign priority points for each piece of information:
    - price:
       match = 3 points
       1 off = 1 points
       2 off = 0 points
    - cuisine:
      match = 5 points
      no match = -2 points
    - locality:
      within: +2 points
      out by 15km: +1 points
      out by more than 15km: -2 points
      out by more than 30km: -100 points
    - dine in or takeaway
      match to host's decision
      If match: +0 points
      No match: -5 points
